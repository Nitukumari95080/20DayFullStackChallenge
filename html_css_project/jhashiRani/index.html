                <h2>The Warrior Queen</h2>
                <p>Rani Lakshmibai, born Manikarnika Tambe in 1828, was one of the most significant figures in India's fight against British rule. She displayed exceptional courage from a young age, mastering horse riding, sword fighting, and archery. Married to Maharaja Gangadhar Rao of Jhansi, she became queen, but after her husband's death in 1853, the British annexed Jhansi under the Doctrine of Lapse. Refusing to surrender, she built a strong army and fiercely resisted British forces in the Revolt of 1857. She defended Jhansi valiantly but was forced to flee, later joining forces with Tatya Tope. In June 1858, she fought bravely in Gwalior but was martyred in combat. Her famous words, "Main apni Jhansi nahi doongi," symbolize her unwavering spirit. She remains a national hero and an inspiration for generations, remembered for her bravery, leadership, and sacrifice in India's struggle for independence.</p>
